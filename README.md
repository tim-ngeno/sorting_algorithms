# Sorting Algorithms in C

This project provides an overview of sorting algorithms in C, including an explanation of the Big O notation and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm.

## Common Sorting Algorithms:

### 1. Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.


### 2. Insertion Sort

Insertion Sort is a sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It takes an element from the input array and places it in the correct position in the sorted array.


### 3. Selection Sort

Selection Sort is a sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted portion of the array and swaps it with the element at the beginning of the unsorted portion.


### 4. Merge Sort

Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the two sorted halves.


### 5. Quick Sort

Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that selects a pivot element and partitions the array around the pivot, placing all smaller elements to the left and larger elements to the right. The pivot point can be at the beginning, or the middle, or the end.



### 6. Heap Sort

Heap Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that builds a binary heap from the input array and repeatedly extracts the maximum element to build the sorted array.


## Big O Notation

The Big O notation is used to describe the time complexity of an algorithm, representing the upper bound on the growth rate of an algorithm's running time. It provides a way to analyze the efficiency and scalability of algorithms.

## Evaluating Time Complexity

To evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm, we consider the number of operations performed relative to the input size. This helps us understand how the algorithm's performance scales as the input size increases.

The time complexity is often expressed using Big O notation, which simplifies the evaluation by focusing on the most significant terms and ignoring constants and lower-order terms.

For example, an algorithm with a time complexity of O(n^2) means that the number of operations grows quadratically with the input size.

## Conclusion

In this README, we discussed various sorting algorithms implemented in C, including Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort. We also introduced the concept of Big O notation and explained how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm.

A good understanding of these concepts is instrumental in making informed decisions when selecting sorting algorithms for different scenarios, and analyzing their efficiency based on the input size.
